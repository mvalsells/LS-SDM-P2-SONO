Pr√†ctica P2, Fase A - Sistemes Digitals i Microprocessadors, Curs 2020-21

## Description
This is my 1st project working with Assembly and 1st time using a PIC18F4321, it was developed by me and my colleague Albert Garangou. Being the first one, it is obvious that there are things to improve but, in general, I am happy with the results.
